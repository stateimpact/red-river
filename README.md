Dried Out: Tracking the Texas Drought
=====================================

To update map-slider:

 1. Download the latest shapefiles from the [US Drought Monitoring Center][usdm]
 2. Unzip files and add them to the `data` directory. The folder and shapefile within should be named something like `usdm120412`.
 3. Run `fab rebuild`
